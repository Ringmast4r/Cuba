DOCUMENT IDENTIFIERS
====================
DocumentID:         xmp.did:5B5B8435AEEDF011AF9F938FF2CD4185
InstanceID:         xmp.iid:5C5B8435AEEDF011AF9F938FF2CD4185
OriginalDocumentID: xmp.did:5B5B8435AEEDF011AF9F938FF2CD4185

FORENSIC VALUE:
- DocumentID is unique to this Photoshop installation
- Can be used to correlate other images from same workstation
- The "5B5B8435AEEDF011" prefix may identify the specific machine
- InstanceID increments (5B -> 5C) showing save operation


EDIT HISTORY (XMP)
==================
Action #1: CREATED
  Timestamp:  2026-01-09T17:54:15-05:00
  Software:   Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)

Action #2: SAVED
  Timestamp:  2026-01-09T17:54:52-05:00
  Software:   Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)

WORKFLOW ANALYSIS:
- Only 2 actions recorded (create + save)
- No intermediate edits logged
- Suggests simple open-edit-save workflow
- Possibly resized from larger original


COLOR PROFILE
=============
ICC Profile:    sRGB IEC61966-2.1
Profile Size:   2,548 bytes
Color Mode:     3 (RGB)

Standard web-safe color profile indicating image prepared for online use.


GPS / LOCATION DATA
===================
GPS Coordinates:    NOT PRESENT
GPS Tags:           NOT PRESENT

No geographic data embedded in this image.


SECURITY ASSESSMENT
===================
EXPOSED INFORMATION:
  [!] Editing software and version (Photoshop CS6)
  [!] Operating system (Windows)
  [!] Exact creation/modification timestamps
  [!] Timezone revealing geographic location
  [!] Unique document IDs (machine fingerprint)
  [!] Edit history and workflow

NOT EXPOSED:
  [+] GPS coordinates
  [+] Camera/device information
  [+] Photographer name
  [+] Original filename

RISK LEVEL: MODERATE
- Timestamps enable activity pattern analysis
- Document IDs enable cross-image correlation
- Software version reveals potential vulnerabilities


INTELLIGENCE VALUE
==================
1. TEMPORAL INTELLIGENCE
   - Image created Thursday Jan 9, 2026 at 5:54 PM Cuba time
   - Indicates late afternoon publishing workflow
   - 37-second edit suggests quick web preparation

2. TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE
   - RadioRebelde using legacy Photoshop CS6
   - Windows-based workstations
   - 72 DPI output = web-only preparation

3. CORRELATION POTENTIAL
   - DocumentID prefix "5B5B8435AEEDF011" is machine-specific
   - Could identify other images from same workstation
   - Search for matching IDs in other captured images

4. OPERATIONAL PATTERNS
   - Late afternoon content preparation
   - Quick turnaround (sub-minute edits)
   - Direct-to-web workflow


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ARTICLE
===========================
Key points to highlight:

1. Cuban state media (RadioRebelde) not stripping EXIF metadata
2. Using outdated software (Photoshop CS6 from 2012)
3. Timestamps reveal exact content creation times
4. Unique machine identifiers enable tracking
5. Simple metadata stripping would prevent this exposure
